            Hi, I'm Sarah! I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, but relocated to Seattle in
            2015 with my husband and two pups for a change of scenery. I'm an aspiring web developer with 8+ years
            of
            digital marketing experience under my belt, including content writing, email marketing, and social
            media.
            I'm creative and thrive in environments that allow for growth
            and constant learning.
            <br>
            <br>
            When not at work, I enjoy kicking back with a video game (action-adventure RPGs are my thing), but also
            love
            exploring or checking out new breweries and restaurants.
